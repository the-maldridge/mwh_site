title: About
---

My name is Michael Aldridge, I work with computers and this is my
website.  From time to time I post information here on projects I'm
working on or on things that I've found that I want to make sure I can
find again.

I'm probably one of the most demanding engineers I know.  I don't
tolerate bullshit and I expect correctness in work I am expected to
review, maintain, or otherwise support.  I expect only the best, and I
am deeply disappointed when organizations settle for less.  No
business reason is worth jeopardizing the longterm maintainability of
your company for.

In my spare time I work on Void Linux as the guy that manages the
infrastructure and build pipelines.

The information on this site is interesting to me, I hope it can be of
use to others.  If you have any questions feel free
to [email me](mailto:aldridge.mac@gmail.com).
