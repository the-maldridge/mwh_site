As I imagined getting Void into the T100TA would not be easy.  It
required custom install media and lots of fuss to get it to boot and
then even more to install.  Right now this just isn't ready for prime
time, the wifi doesn't even work!

Update January 2017: Wifi works out of the box now

Update March 2017: Void supports hybrid boot, its possible to run x64 kernels now

Update September 2017: Standard Void media can be used to install now
