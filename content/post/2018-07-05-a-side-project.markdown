For about a year now I've been working on a side project.  After
working at UTD and having run LDAP and Kerberos, I thought it would be
very nice to have something like those services, but much easier to
stand up and operate.  Thus NetAuth was born.  If you'd like to find
out more, NetAuth lives at [https://netauth.org](https://netauth.org).
