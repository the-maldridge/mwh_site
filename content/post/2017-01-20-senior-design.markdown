Senior design is shaping up just as bad as everyone said it would be.

---

Update February 2017: This program is wierd, how did we get our project approved?

Update March 2017: I've heard of software scope creep, but never this bad.

Update April 2017: Finally a build freeze and bugfix window.

Update May 2017: Finally done; I would not wish this class or
experience on my worst enemies.  I have worked on large design
projects in the past and this was not representative of any of them.
This was representative of what happens when someone tries to squash
all of the normal complexity of running a complete product development
pipeline into a class and then dumb it down to the point that people
who've had no exposure to running a project on a deadline can finish
it.  This has been one of the bigger wastes of time for me.
